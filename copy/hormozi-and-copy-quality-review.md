# Hormozi Method + Copy Quality Review
## Honest Assessment: All 3 Landing Page Versions

---

## REWRITE PASS: CHANGES MADE (January 2026)

Based on the recommendations in this review, all 3 landing page versions were rewritten. Pre-rewrite backups saved to `copy/archive/pre-hormozi-rewrite/`.

### Version A ("The Grounding") -- heaviest rewrite, from grade B to target A-

- **New headline** -- "The Distance Between What You Feel and What You Know Is Growing Every Day" replaces the generic algorithm headline. Derived from the strongest line in the original problem section (previously buried in paragraph 4).
- **Problem agitation cut ~35%** -- Removed elaboration, aspiration paragraph, and cliche closer. Kept the "Maybe it was..." structure and "None of it stuck."
- **Day 1 walkthrough added** -- Integrated into Bridge section. Shows minute-by-minute first morning (6:47 AM verse, 7:15 AM adhkar, evening course). Total: 19 minutes. Collapses time delay and effort simultaneously.
- **Dream Outcome section added (Day 30)** -- Vivid picture of Salma's life after one month: answering coworker questions, adding context at family dinner, 30-day streak. Makes the transformation specific and believable.
- **Two feature sections merged into one** -- Organized by usage mode (daily anchor / deep study / instant answer / live connection) instead of repetitive Bold Name + Description cards. Each mode gets a different format.
- **Hormozi value stack added** -- Pricing section now presents each component with standalone dollar value before revealing the $15/month price. Total standalone value: $4,000+/year.
- **Risk reversal added** -- "Try it for 30 days. If you don't feel closer to your deen, cancel with one tap. No questions. No guilt."
- **Stat repetition eliminated** -- Full stat dump appears ONCE in the Product Introduction stat stack. Other sections reference specific stats contextually without repeating the full list.
- **Objection answers cut ~50%** -- Each answer is now 2-3 sentences max. The YouTube objection uses the tighter "One builds knowledge. The other kills time" closer.
- **Filler removed** -- Cut "real" crutch word (appeared 4+ times), removed marketing-speak sentences, cut the weak Push Notifications feature card, eliminated redundant taglines.
- **Final CTA tightened** -- From 4 sentences to 3. Removed the redundant feature list recap.
- **Scholar bios tightened ~30%** -- Cut generic descriptors, kept credentials + course specifics.
- **Overall: ~18% word count reduction** (from ~2,200 to ~1,800 words)

### Version B ("The Scholars") -- significant rewrite, from grade B+ to target A-

- **Subheadline fixed** -- Removed unsubstantiated "most comprehensive Islamic learning platform in the English-speaking world" superlative. Replaced with factual "Built by AlMaghrib Institute."
- **Scholar showcase tightened** -- Headliner bios cut ~25% each (removed generic descriptors, kept credentials + course specifics). Bottom 5 instructors collapsed from 5 separate bio blocks into a single compact line with key highlights.
- **Problem agitation moved earlier** -- From Section 7 to Section 4, right after the comparison table creates context. Still brief (appropriate for Kareem's persona) but no longer buried deep in the page.
- **Day 1 walkthrough added** -- New Section 5 showing Kareem's first day: morning verse + adhkar, commute course download, lunch AI question, evening dashboard review. Total: 23 minutes.
- **Dream Outcome added (Month 3)** -- New Section 8 painting Kareem at a halaqa explaining qadr from Shaykh Yasir Qadhi's *Predestination* course, getting a fiqh question answered directly in live Q&A, 87-day streak, 37% curriculum completion. Specific to THIS persona (committed learner wanting depth, not a beginner).
- **Two feature sections merged** -- Organized by mode (daily practice / study tools / live access / instant answer) instead of repetitive feature cards.
- **Objection answers cut ~40%** -- Each answer is now 2-3 sentences. Removed redundant stat repetition within answers.
- **Hormozi value stack added** -- Pricing section now presents each component with standalone dollar value. Total: $4,000+/year vs $120/year.
- **Risk reversal added** -- "Try it for 30 days. If it doesn't change how you learn your deen, cancel with one tap."
- **Final CTA drastically tightened** -- Removed the full scholar name list and complete stat dump that repeated everything from earlier sections. Now 2 sentences + CTA.
- **Stat repetition reduced** -- Full stat dump appears once in hero subheadline and once in course library header. Other sections use specific contextual stats.
- **Redundant sentence removed** -- "It takes the depth of a seminary and the convenience of your phone, and puts both in your pocket" (redundant "pocket" = "phone").
- **Overall: ~17% word count reduction** (from ~2,400 to ~2,000 words)

### Version C ("The Gift") -- lighter touch, from grade A- to target A

- **Stat stack rewritten in guardian voice** -- The generic marketing stat stack ("32 | Structured courses across...") replaced with bulleted list written in Hafsah's voice: "When you gift a subscription, they get..." Each item framed from the gift-giver's perspective.
- **"Real" crutch word removed** -- Replaced "real scholars, real structure" in subheadline with "scholars they trust, structured learning." Replaced "Real scholars. Real depth." in problem section with "Scholars they trust. Depth they can explore at their own pace."
- **Hormozi value stack added** -- Pricing section now includes a table showing standalone value of each component before revealing the $15/month price.
- **Risk reversal added** -- "If they don't use it after 30 days, cancel with one tap. No questions. No guilt. No contract."
- **Final CTA tightened** -- Removed the 3-sentence feature list recap ("Ten scholars. 32 courses. A daily verse...") that repeated the stat dump. Now jumps from "something bigger than your words" directly to "Not a lecture. Not a demand. A gift." Keeps the strong closer: "Whether they walk through it -- that's between them and Allah."
- **Objection answers tightened ~30%** -- Each answer is now 2-3 sentences. Kept sharpest lines (fishing rod metaphor, Hafsah's "no pressure" example).
- **Hafsah's story left completely untouched** -- It's the best copy in the entire project.
- **Overall: ~8% word count reduction** (from ~2,600 to ~2,400 words)

### Cross-Version Improvements Applied to All 3

- **Hormozi value stack** added to every pricing section (each component with standalone dollar value)
- **Risk reversal** added to every pricing section ("Try 30 days, cancel with one tap")
- **Stat repetition** reduced across all versions (full dump once, then contextual references)
- **Feature card monotony** fixed (varied format instead of identical Bold Name + 2-3 sentences)
- **Objection answers** shortened across all versions (target: 2-3 sentences each)
- **"Real" crutch word** replaced throughout

### What Was NOT Changed (Flagged for Future)

- **Persona-matched testimonials** -- Version A (Salma persona) still has no testimonial from a 22-35 "searching" Muslim. Version B (Kareem persona) still has no testimonial from a committed learner. Flagged for Phase 2 when real testimonials can be collected.
- **Denominational/madhab positioning** -- Still unaddressed across all 3 versions. This is a real reservation for the target audience.
- **Urgency/scarcity** -- No reason to act "today" vs "next week." Could add "new course launching this month" or "live Q&A this Thursday" when real events are available.

## PART 1: HORMOZI VALUE EQUATION AUDIT

The Hormozi Value Equation:

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

Every element of the copy should be pushing one of these four levers.

### How each version scores:

| Lever | What it means | Version A | Version B | Version C |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dream Outcome (UP)** | Does the reader vividly see their life after? | Moderate | Weak | Strong |
| **Perceived Likelihood (UP)** | Do they believe it'll work for THEM? | Moderate | Moderate | Strong (Hafsah) |
| **Time Delay (DOWN)** | How fast do they see results? | Good | Good | Good |
| **Effort & Sacrifice (DOWN)** | How easy does it feel? | Good | Moderate | Good |

### What's working:

**Time Delay** is handled well across all 3 versions. "5 minutes a day," "start in minutes," "daily verse before you open your email" -- these all collapse the time-to-first-result. This is the copy's strongest Hormozi lever.

**Effort & Sacrifice** is decent. $0.50/day anchoring, "no prerequisites," "no homework," "self-paced," "cancel anytime" -- these reduce friction. The price comparison tables do their job.

### What's NOT working:

**Dream Outcome is undercooked in Versions A and B.** The Hormozi method says: make the dream outcome so vivid and desirable that everything else becomes a question of "how" not "whether."

- **Version A** names the gap ("the distance between what you feel and what you know") but never paints the AFTER picture vividly enough. What does Salma's life look like 6 months in? The closest we get is "You want to be the Muslim who can answer their child's questions with confidence" -- one sentence buried in the problem section. That should be its own section, painted in specific detail.
- **Version B** barely has a dream outcome at all. It's all roster and features. Kareem knows what he wants, but the copy never shows him what his life looks like after 6 months of structured learning. It jumps straight to "here's what you get."
- **Version C** is the strongest here because Hafsah's testimonial IS the dream outcome -- a daughter re-engaged, asking questions again, building a streak. That's vivid and specific.

**Perceived Likelihood is relying too heavily on social proof stats.** "10,000+ students" and "AlMaghrib's 20-year track record" are fine, but the Hormozi method builds perceived likelihood through specificity of mechanism -- showing the reader exactly HOW the system works in a way that makes success feel inevitable. The copy describes features but doesn't walk the reader through a "Day 1 → Day 7 → Day 30 → Day 90" progression that would make them think "oh, I can see exactly how this would work for me."

## PART 2: HORMOZI 5-STEP PROCESS AUDIT

### Step 1: Key User Actions -- INCOMPLETE

Our plan identified 7 user actions:
1. Recognize the need
2. Find a trusted source
3. Commit to learning
4. Start learning
5. Build consistency
6. Apply knowledge
7. Get answers to specific questions

**Missing action: DECIDE to pay.** The Hormozi exercise treats the purchase decision itself as a user action with its own set of problems/reservations. Our copy handles this in the objection-handling section, but it's treated as an afterthought rather than a core part of the framework.

### Step 2: Problems/Reservations -- GOOD BUT NOT EXHAUSTIVE

We identified the right top-level problems. But the Hormozi method goes deeper -- it lists EVERY reservation, even the ones that feel minor. Some missing ones:

- "I'll forget this app exists after a week" (partially addressed by streaks, but never named directly as a fear)
- "My spouse/family will think I'm wasting money on another app"
- "I don't want to learn on a screen -- I want a real teacher"
- "I've been burned by other Islamic apps that had bad content"
- "What if the scholars' views conflict with my madhab?"
- "Is this Sunni? Shia? Salafi? Which orientation?"

That last one is a significant unaddressed reservation for the target audience. Denominational alignment is a real concern that the copy pretends doesn't exist.

### Step 3: Solution Statements -- PRESENT BUT BURIED

The Hormozi method creates explicit "Problem → Solution" pairings. Our copy does this implicitly -- features are described -- but rarely uses the explicit format:

**What Hormozi would do:**
> "Worried you'll start and never finish? The streak counter and daily push notifications make quitting harder than continuing. Our completion rate is [X]% because the daily habit is only 5 minutes."

**What we wrote (Version A, Objection Handling):**
> "That's exactly what the streak counter, push notifications, and daily content are designed to prevent. When your learning shows up on your lock screen every morning, forgetting isn't an option. You don't have to remember to learn. The app remembers for you."

The version we wrote is fine, but it's in the objection section -- deep into the page. The Hormozi method would weave these problem→solution pairs throughout, not save them for a Q&A at the bottom.

### Step 4: Delivery Mechanisms -- NOT LEVERAGED

The Hormozi exercise uses the "Delivery Cube" to brainstorm how solutions are delivered (1:1, 1:few, 1:many; video, audio, text, live; DIY, DWY, DFY). Our copy mentions the delivery mechanisms (video courses, live Q&A, AI assistant, daily push content) but doesn't frame them through the Hormozi lens of "we've thought of every possible way to help you succeed."

**What's missing:** The copy never says "here's why we chose THIS combination." A Hormozi-style stack would present it as:

> "We could have just given you courses. But courses alone don't work -- you need daily accountability (streaks), instant answers (AI), live access (weekly Q&A), and a daily habit (verse + adhkar) to actually build knowledge. That's why Faith Essentials combines all five."

This "we've already thought of everything" framing is the heart of Hormozi's value stacking, and it's absent from all 3 versions.

### Step 5: Trim and Stack -- PARTIAL

The pricing sections do price anchoring well (seminar costs, tutoring costs). But the Hormozi "stack" is more than price comparison -- it's presenting each component of the offer as if it were a standalone product with its own value:

> "The 32 courses alone would cost $1,600+ if you bought them individually. The weekly live Q&A access? That's $50-100/session anywhere else. The AI assistant? Similar tools cost $20-30/month. The daily verse + tafsir? It doesn't exist anywhere else at any price."

Version B does this in its pricing table, which is the closest to a proper Hormozi stack. Versions A and C don't stack as effectively.

## PART 3: COPY QUALITY ASSESSMENT

Judged against the standards of top direct-response copywriters (Gary Halbert, Eugene Schwartz, Joanna Wiebe, Eddie Shleyner) and modern SaaS copy (Basecamp, Linear, Notion).

### Headlines

| Version | Headline | Grade | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | "Your Faith Deserves More Than What the Algorithm Feeds You" | B- | Generic. Could be any Islamic app. "The algorithm" is a cliche in 2026. Doesn't name the specific pain or the specific solution. |
| B | "Yasir Qadhi. Omar Suleiman. Yasmin Mogahed..." | A- | Strong. Names ARE the hook. The roster does the selling. Only weakness: it's long for a headline. |
| C | "Your Words Aren't Enough. But the Right Scholars Might Be." | A | Best headline. Names the exact emotional tension of the target persona in 10 words. The period after "Enough" creates a beat. |

### Problem Agitation

**Version A's problem section is the best writing on any of the three pages** -- but it's too long. The "Maybe it was..." paragraph is strong. The "None of it stuck" line is excellent. But it runs ~250 words. A top copywriter would cut it to 150 and hit harder.

Specific issues:
- "You've saved Instagram posts with beautiful calligraphy and good intentions" -- good line
- "The distance between how much your faith means to you and how little you feel you actually know" -- this is the real headline, buried in paragraph 4
- "And the worst part? Every day that passes, the gap gets a little wider." -- cliche closer. A great copywriter would end on something specific and unexpected, not a generic "it's getting worse"

**Version B's problem section is appropriately brief** for its persona but lacks a single sharp line. "Clips aren't courses" is good. The rest is functional.

**Version C's problem section is strong** -- "the more you push, the further they pull away" is the sharpest single line in all 3 versions. Third-person framing works.

### Repetition Problem

All 3 versions repeat the same stats too many times: "32 courses, 10 scholars, 400 lectures, $0.50/day." By the time you reach the pricing section, you've read these numbers 4-5 times each. A reader scanning the page hits the same info block in:
- Hero subheadline
- Stat stack
- Feature descriptions
- Objection handling answers
- Pricing section
- Final CTA

**Fix:** Say it fully ONCE (stat stack). After that, reference with variation or just the most compelling single stat for each context.

### Filler and Weak Sentences

Lines that a top copywriter would cut:

**Version A:**
- "Faith Essentials is the Islamic learning platform built for Muslims who want more than random content -- they want real knowledge, real scholars, and a real daily practice." → "real" three times is lazy. This sentence adds nothing the stat stack doesn't say better.
- "The daily habit keeps you connected. The courses build your foundation. Faith Essentials gives you both." → Three sentences to say "daily habits + courses."
- "Gentle daily nudges. Not spam. A morning tap that says: your deen is waiting for you." → The push notification feature card is the weakest. Everyone describes their notifications as "not spam."

**Version B:**
- "It takes the depth of a seminary and the convenience of your phone, and puts both in your pocket." → "in your pocket" is the same idea as "your phone." Redundant.
- "The most comprehensive Islamic learning platform in the English-speaking world." → Superlative claim with no evidence. This is the kind of line that erodes trust.

**Version C:**
- "Something with real scholars. Real depth. And a daily habit gentle enough to build without force." → Again with "real." This word is a crutch throughout all 3 versions.
- "I tried everything a mother tries." → Beautiful line. Keep.
- "The truth I had to face: my words weren't enough." → Strong. Keep.

### Feature Card Monotony

All 3 versions use the same pattern for every feature card:

```
**Bold Feature Name**
2-3 sentence description.
```

Repeated 4-6 times per section, across 2 sections. That's 8-12 identically formatted blocks. This creates visual and cognitive fatigue. Top copywriters would vary the format:
- Some features get a single line
- Some get a mini-story
- Some are presented as a comparison
- Some use a number as the lead

### Objection Handling

The Q&A format works but the answers are too long. The best objection handling makes the objection feel silly in 1-2 sentences, then offers a single supporting detail.

**Current (Version A):**
> "YouTube gave you 10,000 unstructured videos and no path forward. Faith Essentials gives you 32 structured courses from 10 scholars, daily verse + tafsir, an AI assistant for instant answers, and weekly live Q&A. YouTube is a library with no librarian. This is a curriculum with a daily practice."

**Tighter version:**
> "YouTube has 10,000 Islamic videos and no curriculum. Faith Essentials has 32 courses, 10 scholars, and a daily practice. One builds knowledge. The other kills time."

### Tone Consistency

- **Version A** occasionally slips from "warm and personal" into "marketing speak" -- phrases like "Faith Essentials removes that barrier entirely" break the kitchen-table voice.
- **Version B** is the most tonally consistent -- confident and data-forward throughout.
- **Version C** mostly holds its warm, parental tone, but the stat stack section feels like it was copy-pasted from Version A/B rather than rewritten for Hafsah's voice.

## PART 4: VERSION-SPECIFIC VERDICTS

### Version A: "The Grounding" -- Grade: B

**Strengths:** Best problem agitation of the three. Good emotional arc. The bridge section ("What if closing that gap only took 5 minutes a day?") is well-constructed.

**Weaknesses:**
- Headline is the weakest of the three -- generic and forgettable
- Dream outcome is never painted vividly (what does "the after" look like?)
- Problem section runs long -- cut 30%
- Feature sections are competent but not compelling
- The word "real" appears too many times
- Multiple stat-dumps that repeat each other

**If a top copywriter rewrote this:** They'd start with the line "the distance between how much your faith means to you and how little you feel you actually know" as the headline. They'd add a vivid "imagine" section painting the after-state. They'd cut the feature cards by 40% and make each one solve a named problem.

### Version B: "The Scholars" -- Grade: B+

**Strengths:** Best structural logic. Hero → Scholars → Comparison Table → Courses → Price is a clean funnel. The YouTube vs. FE comparison table is the single best persuasion element across all 3 versions. Scholar bios are specific and credible.

**Weaknesses:**
- No dream outcome section at all -- what does Kareem's life look like after 6 months?
- Scholar showcase is too long (10 bios back-to-back creates fatigue)
- The "full roster" section (bottom 5 instructors) is a wall of text that most readers will skip
- Problem agitation is too brief and too late (Section 7)
- Missing: a transformation story or before/after for THIS persona (Hafsah's story is from a parent's perspective, not a committed learner's)

**If a top copywriter rewrote this:** They'd keep the scholar-name headline, shorten the scholar showcase to 5 headliners with a "+5 more" link, add a before/after story from a committed learner (not a parent), and move the comparison table higher.

### Version C: "The Gift" -- Grade: A-

**Strengths:** The best version. Hafsah's testimonial is genuinely moving and specific. The third-person framing is consistent and effective. "The more you push, the further they pull away" is the sharpest line in all the copy. The gift CTA framing is clear. The course categories organized by emotional need ("For the one who stopped praying") is the smartest structural choice across all 3 versions.

**Weaknesses:**
- The stat stack section (Section 5) breaks voice -- it reads like Version A/B copy pasted in
- The bridge section says "5 of the most respected scholars" -- should be 10 or "some of the most respected"
- The final CTA is good but slightly overwrites: "Whether they walk through it -- that's between them and Allah" is a strong closer, but the 3 sentences before it repeat the feature list again unnecessarily

**If a top copywriter rewrote this:** They'd keep Hafsah's story nearly as-is (it's the best piece of copy in the entire project), rewrite the stat stack in Hafsah's voice, and tighten the final CTA.

---

## PART 5: WHAT'S MISSING ACROSS ALL 3 VERSIONS

1. **A vivid "Day 1" walkthrough.** What literally happens when someone subscribes? Show the first morning: notification arrives, tap, read a verse, listen to adhkar, done in 7 minutes. This collapses time delay and effort simultaneously.

2. **A "Day 30" or "Day 90" vision.** What does the transformation look like at a specific milestone? The Hormozi method makes the dream outcome tangible and time-bound.

3. **Risk reversal.** "Cancel anytime" is mentioned but never positioned as a guarantee. A Hormozi-style offer would frame it more aggressively: "Try it for 30 days. If you don't feel closer to your deen, cancel with one tap. No questions. No guilt."

4. **Social proof from the target persona.** Hafsah is a parent. The 3 real testimonials are from existing students. But Version A (targeting 22-35 "Searching Salma") has no testimonial from someone who matches that profile. Version B (targeting committed 28-45 learners) has no testimonial from that profile either.

5. **Denominational/madhab positioning.** Mentioned above. This is the elephant in the room for Islamic education products and ignoring it creates hesitation.

6. **The "value stack" presentation.** Hormozi presents each offer component as a line item with its own standalone value. None of the versions do this cleanly.

7. **Urgency or scarcity.** The Hormozi method typically includes a reason to act NOW. All 3 versions say "start today" but give no reason why today is better than next week. Even something like "new course launching this month" or "live Q&A this Thursday" would help.

---

## PART 6: SUMMARY

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| Hormozi Value Equation | Time Delay and Effort are well-handled. Dream Outcome and Perceived Likelihood need work. |
| Hormozi 5-Step Process | Steps 1-3 are partially done. Steps 4-5 (delivery cube and value stacking) are largely missing from the copy itself. |
| Headline quality | Version C is strong. Version B is functional. Version A needs a rewrite. |
| Problem agitation | Version A is emotionally strong but too long. Version C is the best balance. |
| Feature presentation | Monotonous format across all 3. Needs variation. |
| Objection handling | Present but verbose. Answers should be 50% shorter. |
| Overall copy tightness | All 3 could lose 20-25% of their word count without losing any persuasive power. The stat repetition is the biggest culprit. |
| World-class standard? | No. This is solid B+ marketing copy. It's better than 90% of what's out there, but it doesn't have the visceral punch of a Gary Halbert letter or the precision of a Basecamp landing page. The main gaps: weak dream-outcome painting, feature monotony, stat repetition, and missing value stack. |

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Add a "Day 1 → Day 30" walkthrough** to each version (tailored to persona)
2. **Rewrite Version A's headline** -- use the buried line about the distance between feeling and knowing
3. **Add a proper Hormozi value stack** to each pricing section
4. **Cut 20% across all versions** -- target stat repetition, filler sentences, and feature card verbosity
5. **Add risk reversal language** ("try 30 days, cancel with one tap")
6. **Fix the "5 scholars" reference** in Version C's bridge section
7. **Vary the feature card format** -- not every feature needs the same Bold Name + 2 sentences structure
8. **Add persona-matched testimonials** if available (or flag as needed for Phase 2)
