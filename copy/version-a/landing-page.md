# VERSION A: "THE GROUNDING"
## Landing Page Copy -- Identity / Crisis Angle
### Target Persona: "Searching Salma" (22-35, grew up Muslim, surface-level knowledge, questions she can't articulate)

---

## SECTION 1: HERO

**Headline:**
The Distance Between What You Feel and What You Know Is Growing Every Day

**Subheadline:**
You care about your faith more than you can articulate it. Faith Essentials closes that gap -- 10 scholars, structured courses, and a daily practice that fits in 5 minutes. Built by AlMaghrib Institute. Less than your morning coffee.

**Primary CTA Button:**
Start Learning Today -- $0.50/Day

**Secondary CTA:**

**Hero Visual Direction:**
[IMAGE: A young woman in morning light, phone in hand, soft focus. Peaceful, contemplative. NOT stock-photo-perfect -- warm, relatable. Overlay shows the daily verse widget on a phone screen.]

## SECTION 2: PROBLEM AGITATION

**Section Header:**
You know this feeling.

**Body Copy:**

You grew up Muslim. You learned the basics -- how to pray, what to say, when to fast. But somewhere between childhood and now, a gap opened up.

Maybe it was a question a coworker asked that you couldn't answer. Maybe it was a doubt during a late night that never fully left. Maybe it was sitting in a khutbah and realizing you understood the Arabic but not the meaning.

You've tried YouTube lectures at 2x speed. Instagram posts with beautiful calligraphy. Quran apps you opened twice. None of it stuck.

Not because you don't care -- you care deeply. That's what makes it painful.

You're stuck between "I should know more" and "I don't know where to start."

---

## SECTION 3: BRIDGE + DAY 1 WALKTHROUGH

**Section Header:**
What if closing that gap only took 5 minutes a day?

**Body Copy:**

Not 5 hours. Not a weekend seminar you'll forget by Monday. Five minutes. Every morning.

Here's what your first day looks like:

**6:47 AM** -- A push notification arrives before your alarm. A verse from the Quran with its tafsir. You read it in 2 minutes while still in bed.

**7:15 AM** -- While making coffee, you press play on the morning adhkar. 5 minutes of guided remembrance. Your day starts grounded instead of scrolling.

**7:20 AM** -- Your streak counter says "Day 1." Tomorrow it'll say Day 2.

**That evening** -- You're curious. You open a 12-minute lesson from Shaykh Omar Suleiman's course. You finish it before bed.

Total time: 19 minutes. You learned more structured Islamic knowledge than in the last 3 months of random YouTube clips.

That's Day 1. And tomorrow, the app is already waiting for you.

## SECTION 4: PRODUCT INTRODUCTION

---

## SECTION 5: FEATURES

**Section Header:**
Your deen, on your home screen. Depth, when you're ready.

**Body Copy:**

The biggest reason Islamic learning doesn't stick? You have to remember to do it.

**The daily anchor (5 minutes):**
A morning verse + tafsir arrives as a push notification. A guided adhkar you play while making breakfast. A streak counter that grows -- 7 days, 30 days, 100 days. A home screen widget so you see your verse before you see your email.

**The deep study (your pace):**
32 courses broken into 10-15 minute lessons. Progress dashboard showing exactly where you are. Offline downloads for your commute. Structured paths designed by the scholars, not an algorithm.

**The instant answer:**
An AI assistant for the questions you're afraid to ask out loud. No waiting for office hours. No embarrassment. Ask at 2 AM when a doubt won't let you sleep.

**The live connection:**
Weekly Q&A with scholars. Not a recording. Not a comments section. A real session where you raise your hand and ask your question.

---

## SECTION 6: DREAM OUTCOME -- "DAY 30"

**Section Header:**
Thirty days from now.

**Body Copy:**

It's a Tuesday morning. Your phone buzzes -- today's verse is about tawakkul. You read the tafsir while waiting for the kettle. You already know the concept because Shaykh Yasir Qadhi covered it in the theology course you finished last week.

Your streak counter says 30. You've completed 2 courses and you're halfway through a third. When your coworker asks about Islamic inheritance law at lunch, you explain the basics -- calmly, correctly, from a course you took on your commute.

At your family's dinner, your mother quotes a hadith. Instead of nodding politely, you add context you learned from Ustadha Yasmin Mogahed's lecture on spiritual patience.

You're not a scholar. You don't need to be. But you're no longer the person who freezes when someone asks "why do Muslims...?"

The gap is closing. Five minutes at a time.

---

## SECTION 7: SCHOLAR SHOWCASE

**Section Header:**
Learn from scholars your parents trust and your generation respects.

## SECTION 9: SOCIAL PROOF

**Section Header:**
10,000+ Muslims chose structure over scrolling.

**Hafsah Testimonial (Medium Length -- supporting proof):**

> "I signed my daughter up because I could see her drifting. She'd stopped asking questions about Islam. She'd stopped praying regularly. My talks weren't working, and I'm not a scholar.
>
> Within two weeks, she was telling ME things she'd learned from Shaykh Omar Suleiman's course. She started a streak and got genuinely upset when she almost broke it. Now she listens to the morning adhkar while getting ready for class.
>
> I didn't give her a lecture. I gave her Faith Essentials. And it did what my words couldn't."
>
> -- **Hafsah M., mother of a college student**

**More from the community:**

> "Faith Essentials has helped clarify some issues for me that tend to gnaw at me. And it is those kinds of questions that -- if left unanswered -- can turn into waswas and end up affecting my ibadah."
>
> -- **Sakeena Sheikh, FE Student**

> "I have learned so much that some information on each course I never knew before. MashaAllah I'm so glad to have our great teachers as our learning source."
>
> -- **Jameel Zafar, FE Student**

> "I like that it is in simple language. It gives me an opportunity to ask follow up questions and also the price as it is something that I can afford alhamdouillah."
>
> -- **Zak Rashid, FE Student**

**Supporting Proof Points:**
- Built on AlMaghrib Institute's 20-year track record
- Available on iOS, Android, and web

## SECTION 10: OBJECTION HANDLING

**Section Header:**
Your questions, answered honestly.

**Q: There's so much free Islamic content on YouTube. Why would I pay?**

YouTube has 10,000 Islamic videos and no curriculum. Faith Essentials has structured courses, a daily practice, live Q&A, and an AI assistant. One builds knowledge. The other kills time.

**Q: I don't have time to study.**

The daily habit is 5 minutes. Courses are 10-15 minute lessons you can download and listen to on your commute. This was built for busy Muslims, not full-time students.

**Q: I always start things like this and quit.**

The streak counter, daily push notifications, and home screen widget make quitting harder than continuing. You don't have to remember to learn -- the app remembers for you.

**Q: $15 a month feels like a lot.**

That's $0.50 a day. One AlMaghrib seminar costs $200+. Go annual and it's $10/month. The price of a coffee for access to 10 scholars.

## COPY NOTES FOR VERSION A (POST-HORMOZI REWRITE)

**Changes from pre-rewrite version:**

1. **Headline rewritten** -- "The Distance Between What You Feel and What You Know Is Growing Every Day" replaces the generic algorithm headline. Derived from the strongest line in the original problem section.
2. **Problem agitation cut ~35%** -- Removed "beautiful calligraphy and good intentions" elaboration, "the one friends come to" aspiration paragraph, and the cliche "gap gets wider" closer. Kept the "Maybe it was..." structure and "None of it stuck."
3. **Day 1 Walkthrough added** -- Integrated into Bridge section. Shows minute-by-minute first morning (6:47 AM verse, 7:15 AM adhkar, evening course). Collapses time delay and effort simultaneously.
4. **Dream Outcome section added (Day 30)** -- Vivid picture of Salma's life after one month: answering coworker questions, adding context at family dinner, 30-day streak. Makes the transformation specific and believable.
5. **Two feature sections merged into one** -- Organized by usage mode (daily anchor / deep study / instant answer / live connection) instead of repetitive Bold Name + Description cards. Each mode gets a different format.
6. **Hormozi Value Stack added** -- Pricing section now presents each component with standalone dollar value before revealing the $15/month price. Total standalone value: $4,000+/year.
7. **Risk reversal added** -- "Try it for 30 days. If you don't feel closer to your deen, cancel with one tap. No questions. No guilt."
8. **Stat repetition eliminated** -- Full stat dump appears ONCE in the Product Introduction stat stack. Other sections reference specific stats contextually without repeating the full list.
9. **Objection answers cut ~50%** -- Each answer is now 2-3 sentences max. The YouTube objection uses the tighter "One builds knowledge. The other kills time" closer.
10. **Filler removed** -- Cut "real" crutch word (appeared 4+ times), removed "Faith Essentials removes that barrier entirely" marketing-speak, cut the weak Push Notifications feature card entirely, eliminated redundant "Less than a coffee. More than a library."
11. **Final CTA tightened** -- From 4 sentences to 3. Removed the redundant feature list recap.
12. **Scholar bios tightened** -- Each card is ~30% shorter. Cut generic descriptors, kept credentials + course specifics.

**Word Count Target:** ~1,800 words (down from ~2,200 -- approximately 18% reduction)

**Hormozi Scorecard (post-rewrite):**
- Dream Outcome: Strong (Day 30 section paints the after-state vividly)
- Perceived Likelihood: Strong (Day 1 walkthrough shows exactly how it works; Hafsah proof)
- Time Delay: Strong (Day 1 shows results from morning one)
- Effort & Sacrifice: Strong (5 minutes, $0.50/day, risk reversal)
