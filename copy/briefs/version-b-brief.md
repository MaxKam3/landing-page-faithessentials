# Version B: "The Scholars" -- Master Brief

## Angle: Access / Authority
**Thesis:** 5 of the most respected scholars in the English-speaking Muslim world. 32 courses. Daily content. Live Q&A. One app. Less than lunch.

## Target Persona: "Committed Kareem"
- **Age:** 28-45
- **Profile:** Already practices, watches Omar Suleiman's Yaqeen videos, has attended AlMaghrib seminars
- **Context:** The barrier isn't motivation -- it's ACCESS and CURATION. He's tired of random YouTube lectures and wants a single, trusted, structured source.
- **Core tension:** Great scholars exist but there's no structured way to learn from them daily.

## Emotional Entry Point
The frustration of having to piece together your Islamic education from scattered YouTube videos, random Instagram clips, and whatever the algorithm serves you. You know who the great scholars are. You just can't access them in a way that builds real knowledge.

## Future-State Features to Emphasize
1. **Scholar roster** -- front and center, the 5 names are the headline
2. **Weekly live Q&A** -- direct access, not just recorded content
3. **32 structured courses** -- curated journey, not random videos
4. **Progress dashboard** -- see your path, track completion
5. **AI assistant** -- get answers between live sessions

## Section Order
1. Hero (scholar faces prominent)
2. Scholar Showcase (IMMEDIATELY -- this is the hook)
3. Product Introduction
4. Course Library Preview (detailed, category breakdown)
5. Daily Habit Features
6. Learning Features
7. Problem Agitation (brief -- Kareem doesn't need much convincing on the problem)
8. Social Proof (Hafsah testimonial as supporting proof)
9. Objection Handling
10. Price Anchoring (HEAVY comparison -- cost of alternatives)
11. Final CTA + Footer

## Key Objections to Destroy
- "Free content exists on YouTube" --> Name one YouTube channel with 10 scholars, 32 courses, live Q&A, and AI. We'll wait.
- "$15/mo when free exists" --> One AlMaghrib seminar = $200+. This is $0.50/day for FIVE scholars.
- "I already watch their content" --> Watching clips isn't studying. Structured courses with progress tracking is studying.
- "Scholars are inaccessible" --> Weekly live Q&A. Ask them directly.

## Tone
Confident, direct, slightly premium. Like a knowledgeable friend who's found something great and is genuinely excited to share it. Data-forward. Name-drops naturally. Respects the reader's existing knowledge.

## Visual Direction
Bold, authoritative. Scholar photos are large and central. Dark backgrounds with gold/green accents. Clean grid layouts. The feeling of a premium educational institution, not a casual app.
