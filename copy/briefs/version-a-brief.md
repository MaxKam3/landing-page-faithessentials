# Version A: "The Grounding" -- Master Brief

## Angle: Identity / Crisis
**Thesis:** You feel the distance growing between you and your deen. Questions pile up. Doubts creep in. Faith Essentials is where you get grounded -- every single day.

## Target Persona: "Searching Salma"
- **Age:** 22-35
- **Profile:** College-educated, grew up Muslim, knowledge is surface-level
- **Context:** Exposed to challenging ideas at work/school. Has questions she can't articulate. Scrolls Islamic social media but it leaves her more confused.
- **Core tension:** The gap between what she feels in her heart and what she can articulate with her mind.

## Emotional Entry Point
The quiet shame of not knowing enough. The fear that your faith is inherited, not earned. The growing distance between who you are and who you want to be as a Muslim.

## Future-State Features to Emphasize
1. **Daily verse + tafsir** -- the "gentle anchor" that meets her every morning
2. **Streak counter** -- visible proof she's growing, not drifting
3. **AI assistant** -- for the questions she's embarrassed to ask out loud
4. **Self-paced courses** -- no judgment, no prerequisites, start anywhere

## Key Objections to Destroy
- "Free content exists on YouTube" --> Unstructured content is what left you confused
- "I don't have time" --> 5 minutes a day. That's it.
- "I start but never finish" --> Streaks + daily push = you won't forget
- "$15/mo when free exists" --> $0.50/day for clarity vs. free confusion

## Tone
Warm, intimate, slightly vulnerable. Like a trusted older sister speaking at a kitchen table. Never preachy. Never condescending. Acknowledges the struggle before offering the solution.

## Visual Direction
Soft, contemplative. A woman on her phone in morning light. Warm earth tones. Space and breathing room in the layout. The feeling of a quiet, personal moment.
