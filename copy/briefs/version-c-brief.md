# Version C: "The Gift" -- Master Brief

## Angle: Family / Community
**Thesis:** Someone you love is drifting. Your words aren't enough. Give them access to scholars, structure, and a daily connection to their deen.

## Target Persona: "Guardian Hafsah"
- **Age:** 30-50
- **Profile:** Parent, older sibling, or community leader. Grounded in their own faith.
- **Context:** Worried about someone they love losing their connection to Islam. Their personal lectures aren't working. They've tried talking. They've tried forwarding videos. Nothing sticks.
- **Core tension:** The helplessness of watching someone you love drift, and knowing your words aren't enough.

## Emotional Entry Point
You can see it happening. The prayers becoming less frequent. The questions they used to ask -- gone quiet. You've tried sharing videos, recommending books, having conversations. But you're not a scholar. And they need more than your worry. They need a way back in that doesn't feel like pressure.

## Future-State Features to Emphasize
1. **Flexibility** -- self-paced, mobile, offline (removes "I'm too busy" excuse)
2. **Daily habits without pressure** -- streaks, morning adhkar (gentle, not forceful)
3. **Community** -- they won't be alone in their struggle
4. **Direct scholar access** -- weekly live Q&A gives them a real teacher
5. **AI assistant** -- answers questions they won't ask you

## Key Objections to Destroy
- "Will they actually use it?" --> Daily push notifications + 5-min content + streaks. It meets them where they are.
- "I can just share YouTube links" --> You've tried that. Structured learning with daily habits is different.
- "They won't pay for it" --> Gift it. $120/year. Less than a birthday dinner.
- "They'll feel lectured at" --> Self-paced. No judgment. They choose when, where, and what.

## Tone
Empathetic, parental, slightly urgent but not panicked. Like a conversation between concerned parents after the kids go to bed. Validates the helplessness before offering a way to act. Never guilt-tripping -- empowering.

## Visual Direction
Warm, familial. Photos of families, parent-child moments, community gatherings. Soft lighting, warm colors. The feeling of home and belonging. Gift-giving imagery for the CTA sections.
