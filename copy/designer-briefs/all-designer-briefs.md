# DESIGNER BRIEFS -- ALL 3 VERSIONS

---

# VERSION A: "THE GROUNDING" -- Designer Brief

## Mood
Warm, contemplative, personal. Think: early morning light in a quiet room. The feeling of a private moment of reflection. Soft without being weak.

## Color Palette
- Primary: Warm earth tones -- soft gold (#D4A853), deep clay (#8B5E3C), warm white (#FAF7F2)
- Accent: Muted teal (#5B8C8D) for CTAs and interactive elements
- Text: Dark charcoal (#2D2D2D) on warm white backgrounds
- Avoid: Harsh greens, bright blues, or anything that reads "corporate Islamic"

## Typography
- Headlines: Serif or elegant sans-serif. Warm, not cold. Think: Freight Display or Playfair Display
- Body: Clean, readable sans-serif. Inter, Source Sans, or similar
- Arabic script (if used): As accent/decoration only, not primary text

## Layout Principles
- Generous white space. This page breathes.
- Single-column for Problem Agitation section -- immersive reading experience
- Cards for features. Grid for scholar showcase. Table for pricing.
- Mobile-first: every section must work as a single scroll on a phone

## Key Visual Elements
1. **Hero:** Woman in morning light with phone. Soft focus background. NOT a stock photo smile -- contemplative, real, relatable. Widget overlay showing daily verse on phone screen.
2. **Problem Agitation:** Minimal visuals. Let the text carry. Perhaps a subtle gradient or background texture shift to signal "we're going deeper here."
3. **Scholar Photos:** Medium-sized, warm-toned. Not the bold grid of Version B -- more like portraits in a warm setting. Each with name and a single credibility line.
4. **Feature Cards:** Icon + headline + 2-line description. Soft rounded corners. Warm shadow.
5. **Streak Mockup:** Phone screen showing streak at "Day 42" or similar. Morning adhkar player visible.
6. **Pricing Section:** Clean comparison table. Faith Essentials row highlighted. Gold accent on the annual plan.
7. **Hafsah Testimonial:** Styled as a quote block with a subtle left border. Photo of Hafsah optional (with permission). Warm background color behind the quote.
8. **Final CTA:** Full-width. Warm background. Both pricing buttons visible. Trust bar below.

# VERSION B: "THE SCHOLARS" -- Designer Brief

## Mood
Bold, authoritative, premium. Think: the website of a prestigious educational institution. Confident without being arrogant. The feeling of "you're getting access to something special."

## Color Palette
- Primary: Deep navy (#1A2744), crisp white (#FFFFFF), gold accent (#C5A55A)
- Secondary: Rich green (#1B5E3E) as an Islamic accent
- Text: White on dark backgrounds for hero/scholar sections, dark on white for content sections
- Avoid: Pastels, warm earth tones (that's Version A), or anything that reads "casual"

## Typography
- Headlines: Bold, confident sans-serif. Montserrat Bold, or similar. ALL CAPS for scholar names in hero.
- Body: Clean sans-serif. Inter Medium, or similar
- Numbers/stats: Large, bold, possibly in gold -- stats should be visually prominent

## Layout Principles
- Two-column and grid layouts where possible. This page is information-dense.
- Scholar section: large photo cards in a 5-column grid (desktop), scrollable on mobile
- Course library: category tabs with course cards below
- Comparison tables should be prominent and easy to scan
- Mobile: card-based, swipeable where appropriate

## Key Visual Elements
1. **Hero:** Scholar names large and central. A grid of 10 scholar photos below the headline (top row: 5 headliners, second row: 5 additional instructors). Dark background. Gold accents. This hero IS the scholars -- not a generic image.
2. **Scholar Showcase:** Full-width section. Each scholar gets a large card: photo, name, credentials, courses taught. Dark background. Premium treatment.
3. **Course Library:** Tab interface by category. Each course card shows: title, instructor, lesson count, thumbnail. Clean grid.
4. **Comparison Table:** YouTube/Instagram vs. Faith Essentials. Two-column, checkmarks vs. X marks. Visual and scannable.
5. **Feature Cards:** Icon + headline + brief description. Crisp edges. Navy or white backgrounds.
6. **Price Anchoring:** Large comparison table. Seminar costs, private tutoring, university -- all with real dollar amounts. FE highlighted in gold.
7. **Hafsah Testimonial:** Small quote box. Clean, not emotional. A data point among others.
8. **Final CTA:** Dark background. Scholar names restated. Both pricing options. Gold CTA buttons.

# VERSION C: "THE GIFT" -- Designer Brief

## Mood
Warm, familial, hopeful. Think: the lighting of a family kitchen at golden hour. The feeling of care, concern, and a quiet act of love. Emotional without being heavy.

## Color Palette
- Primary: Warm cream (#FFF8F0), soft rose (#D4847C), deep warm brown (#4A3228)
- Accent: Soft sage green (#7BA68D) for CTAs and hope-signals
- Text: Deep brown (#3D2B1F) on cream backgrounds
- Avoid: Cold blues, corporate navy (that's Version B), bright colors

## Typography
- Headlines: Warm serif. Georgia, Merriweather, or Lora. Personal, not institutional.
- Body: Soft sans-serif. Nunito, Lato, or similar
- Testimonial text: Slightly larger, italic option for Hafsah's quotes

## Layout Principles
- Long-form, story-driven layout. This page reads more like a letter than a product page.
- Hafsah testimonial section should be immersive -- full width, generous padding, distinct background
- Features are secondary to story. Present them as "what they'll get" not "what the product does"
- Gift CTA should be visually distinct from "start your own" CTA
- Mobile-first: the story must flow naturally on a phone

## Key Visual Elements
1. **Hero:** Intergenerational photo -- parent and young adult, or older/younger sibling. Candid, warm, not posed. Phone visible but not central. The relationship IS the image.
2. **Hafsah Testimonial (Section 2):** Full-width storytelling section. Different background color (warmer, slightly darker cream or soft rose). Large quote marks. Story text in a readable size with generous line spacing. Photo of Hafsah if available. This section should feel like opening a personal letter.
3. **Problem Agitation:** Sparse visuals. Let the words land. Maybe a subtle illustration of distance or connection.
4. **Scholar Cards:** Warm treatment. Smaller than Version B. The emphasis is on "scholars they'll listen to" -- approachable, not intimidating.
5. **Feature Section:** Framed as "what they need" -- each feature card addresses a barrier ("for the one who says 'I don't have time'"). Cards should feel solution-oriented, not feature-listy.
6. **Course Preview:** Organized by emotional need ("for the one with questions," "for the one who's hurting") rather than academic category.
7. **Gift CTA:** Visually distinct section. Gift-wrapping or "giving" imagery. Two buttons: "Gift a Subscription" (primary, sage green) and "Start Your Own" (secondary, outlined).
8. **Final CTA:** The "door" metaphor visualized. Warm light through an open doorway. Emotional close.

## Image/Asset Requirements
| Section | Asset Needed | Type |
|---|---|---|
| Hero | Parent/child or family moment | Photo (candid, warm) |
| Hafsah Section | Hafsah photo (if available) | Photo |
| Hafsah Section | Decorative quote marks, background | Designed element |
| Scholar Cards | 10 scholar/instructor headshots (warm treatment) | Photos (from /assets/images/) |
| Features | Icons or small illustrations | Icons |
| Course Preview | Course cards (need-based framing) | Designed cards |
| Gift CTA | Gift-themed visual (ribbon, warmth) | Illustration or designed element |
| Final CTA | Open doorway with warm light | Photo or illustration |
| Trust Bar | AlMaghrib logo, app store badges | Logos |
