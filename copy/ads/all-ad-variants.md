# VERSION A ADS: "THE GROUNDING" (Identity/Crisis Angle)

## Ad A1: The Question You Can't Answer

**Hook:** When was the last time someone asked you a question about Islam and you actually knew the answer?

**Problem:** You grew up Muslim. You pray, you fast, you believe. But the gap between what you feel and what you can explain keeps growing. YouTube clips aren't filling it. Instagram posts aren't either.

**Solution:** Faith Essentials gives you 10 scholars, 32 structured courses, and a daily verse + tafsir delivered to your phone every morning. Plus an AI assistant for the questions you're too embarrassed to ask out loud.

**Offer:** $0.50/day. 10 scholars. 32 courses. Daily content. AI answers. Live Q&A every week.

**CTA Button:** Start Learning Today

**Image Direction:** Person on phone, early morning light, contemplative expression. Overlay: daily verse widget mockup.

## Ad A2: The 5-Minute Morning

**Hook:** What if closing the gap in your Islamic knowledge only took 5 minutes a day?

**Problem:** You've tried YouTube playlists. You've saved Instagram posts. You've downloaded apps you opened twice. Nothing sticks because nothing shows up for you. You have to chase it.

**Solution:** Faith Essentials sends you a verse + tafsir every morning. A 5-minute guided adhkar. A streak counter that proves you're growing. When you want more: 32 courses from Yasir Qadhi, Omar Suleiman, Yasmin Mogahed, and more.

**Offer:** Start with 5 minutes. Go deeper when you're ready. $15/month or $120/year. Cancel anytime.

**CTA Button:** Try 5 Minutes Tomorrow Morning

**Image Direction:** Phone screen showing streak counter at "Day 14" with morning adhkar playing. Warm tones.

## Ad A3: The Drift

**Hook:** You can feel it, can't you? The distance between you and your deen.

**Problem:** Not dramatic. Not a crisis. Just... a slow drift. The questions you stopped asking. The knowledge you meant to build. The confidence you wish you had when Islam comes up at work or with friends.

**Solution:** Faith Essentials is where 10,000+ Muslims are quietly closing that gap. Daily verse + tafsir. 5-minute morning adhkar. 32 courses from scholars your family trusts. An AI that answers instantly. A streak that grows.

**Offer:** $0.50/day. Less than a coffee. More than YouTube ever gave you.

**CTA Button:** Start Learning

**Image Direction:** Split image -- left side: someone scrolling social media, unfocused. Right side: same person engaged with the FE app, morning light. Subtle transformation.

# VERSION B ADS: "THE SCHOLARS" (Access/Authority Angle)

## Ad B1: The Roster

**Hook:** Yasir Qadhi. Omar Suleiman. Yasmin Mogahed. Waleed Basyouni. Abu Eesa. And 5 more. One app. $0.50/day.

**Problem:** You know their names. You watch their clips. But a 3-minute Instagram reel isn't a course. And a yearly conference isn't consistent access. There's never been a way to study with all of them -- structured, daily, with live Q&A.

**Solution:** Faith Essentials: 10 scholars, 32 structured courses, 400 lectures, weekly live Q&A, daily verse + tafsir, AI assistant, progress dashboard. One subscription.

**Offer:** $15/month or $120/year. 32 courses. Nearly 80 hours. Live Q&A every week. Cancel anytime.

**CTA Button:** See All 32 Courses

**Image Direction:** Grid of all 10 scholar photos. Clean, dark background. Names and credentials visible. Premium, authoritative feel.

---

## Ad B2: The Seminar Math

**Hook:** One AlMaghrib seminar costs $200. Faith Essentials gives you 32 courses from 10 scholars for $10/month.

**Problem:** You love AlMaghrib's depth. But seminars happen once, cost $200+, and cover one topic. You want that level of scholarship consistently -- not once a year.

**Solution:** Faith Essentials is AlMaghrib's streaming platform. 32 courses. 10 scholars. 400 lectures. Daily content. Weekly live Q&A. Progress tracking. Offline downloads. Everything the seminars gave you, available daily.

**Offer:** Annual: $120/year ($10/month). Monthly: $15/month. That's $0.50/day for what used to cost $200 a weekend.

**CTA Button:** Get Full Access

**Image Direction:** Side-by-side comparison: conference ticket stub ($200) vs. phone with FE app open ($0.50/day). Visual price anchor.

## Ad B3: YouTube vs. Curriculum

**Hook:** YouTube has 10,000 Islamic lectures. Faith Essentials has 32 structured courses. One of these builds knowledge. The other kills time.

**Problem:** You've been assembling your Islamic education from scattered YouTube lectures and podcast episodes. No structure. No progression. No way to know if you're actually learning or just consuming.

**Solution:** Faith Essentials gives you a curriculum: 32 courses across 7 categories, taught by 10 scholars, with progress tracking, structured paths, and an AI assistant. Plus daily content and weekly live Q&A.

**Offer:** $0.50/day. Structure beats chaos. Cancel anytime.

**CTA Button:** Browse the Curriculum

**Image Direction:** Two phones side-by-side. Left: YouTube with dozens of random thumbnails, cluttered. Right: FE app with clean course categories and progress bars. Visual clarity.

# VERSION C ADS: "THE GIFT" (Family/Community Angle)

## Ad C1: Hafsah's Story

**Hook:** "My daughter stopped praying after her first year of college. Faith Essentials did what my lectures couldn't."

**Problem:** Hafsah watched her daughter drift. The questions about Islam stopped. The prayers became inconsistent. She tried forwarding YouTube videos. She tried conversations at dinner. Nothing worked.

**Solution:** She gifted her daughter Faith Essentials. Two weeks later, her daughter mentioned something she'd learned from Shaykh Omar Suleiman -- at dinner, casually. Within a month: a 21-day streak, morning adhkar while getting ready, and questions about Islam flowing again.

**Offer:** Gift a subscription: $15/month or $120/year. 10 scholars. 32 courses. Daily content. No pressure. Just a door.

**CTA Button:** Give the Gift of Knowledge

**Image Direction:** A parent and young adult sharing a moment. Warm, candid, familial. Not posed. A phone visible but not central. The focus is the relationship, not the product.

---

## Ad C2: Someone You Love

**Hook:** Someone you love is drifting from their deen. Your words aren't enough.

**Problem:** You've tried talking. You've tried sharing videos. You've tried recommending books. But you're not a scholar. And the more you push, the more they pull away. You need something that isn't you.

**Solution:** Faith Essentials gives them access to 10 scholars, 32 courses, and a daily practice that meets them where they are. Self-paced. Mobile. No pressure. A daily verse on their lock screen. An AI for the questions they won't ask you.

**Offer:** $0.50/day. Not a lecture. A gift. Cancel anytime.

**CTA Button:** Gift Faith Essentials

**Image Direction:** Person looking at their phone with a thoughtful, slightly worried expression. Warm lighting. The emotion is concern, not fear. Supportive, not dramatic.

---

## Ad C3: The Door

**Hook:** You can't want it for them. But you can open the door.

**Problem:** Your child, your sibling, your friend -- they're drifting. You can see it. The prayers. The questions. The connection. It's fading. And every conversation you start feels like it pushes them further away.

**Solution:** Faith Essentials is what Hafsah gave her daughter. Ten scholars. Daily content. A streak counter. An AI assistant. Weekly live Q&A. All on their phone. All at their pace. Not your voice. The voice of Yasir Qadhi, Omar Suleiman, Yasmin Mogahed.

**Offer:** $120/year. Less than a birthday dinner. More than a library of YouTube links. Cancel anytime.

**CTA Button:** Open the Door for Someone You Love

**Image Direction:** An open door with warm light streaming through. Metaphorical but grounded -- could be a real doorway in a home. Inviting, not heavy.
