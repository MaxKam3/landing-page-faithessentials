# Quality Control Checklist -- Landing Page Copy

This checklist should be run after every copy draft or revision. It catches the kinds of errors that slipped through in Round 1 (fabricated course names, wrong instructor counts, incorrect lesson counts).

---

## 1. Factual Accuracy (CRITICAL)

### Course Data (Source: `reference-docs/Faith Essentials - Comprehensive Course Catalog.md`)
- [ ] Every course name mentioned is a real course from the catalog
- [ ] Every lecture count matches the catalog (e.g., *Fiqh of Prayer* = 21, not 8)
- [ ] Every duration cited matches the catalog (e.g., *Timeless Expression* = 9.1 hrs)
- [ ] Every instructor-to-course mapping is correct (e.g., *Fiqh of Prayer* is Abu Eesa, NOT Waleed Basyouni)
- [ ] Total courses = 32 (not 33, not "over 30")
- [ ] Total lectures = 400
- [ ] Total duration = 79.7 hours (use "nearly 80 hours" or "80 hours" in copy)
- [ ] Total categories = 7

### Instructor Data (Source: catalog + `assets/images/instructors/`)
- [ ] Total instructors = 10
- [ ] 5 headliners: Yasir Qadhi (5 courses), Omar Suleiman (4), Yasmin Mogahed (1), Waleed Basyouni (7), Abu Eesa (6)
- [ ] 5 additional: Taimiyyah Zubair (2), Abdullah Hakim Quick (2), Saad Tasleem (2), Omar Hedroug (2), Riad Ouarzazi (1)
- [ ] Instructor images exist for all mentioned: AbdulbaryYahya.webp(?), AbuEesa.webp, Ammar.webp(?), OmarHedroug.webp, OmarSuleiman.webp, Saad.webp, Sarah.webp(?), Suleiman.webp(?), Waleed.webp, Yasmin.webp
- [ ] NOTE: Some image filenames don't map cleanly to instructors (e.g., "Ammar.webp", "Sarah.webp") -- clarify with stakeholder which images correspond to which instructors
- [ ] NOTE: No image found for Taimiyyah Zubair, Abdullah Hakim Quick, or Riad Ouarzazi -- confirm availability

### Business Data (Source: `Strategic-Alignment-Document-V2.md`)
- [ ] Student count: 10,000+ (lifetime); 2,100+ (active subscribers -- internal metric, do NOT use on landing pages)
- [ ] Monthly churn: 2.8% (internal metric only -- do NOT use on landing pages)
- [ ] Pricing: $15/month, $120/year
- [ ] $0.50/day math is correct ($15/30 = $0.50)
- [ ] $10/month annual math is correct ($120/12 = $10)
- [ ] Save $60 claim is correct ($15 x 12 = $180; $180 - $120 = $60)
- [ ] AlMaghrib Institute: 20+ year track record (founded 2002)

### Category Mapping
- [ ] Fiqh (Jurisprudence): 11 courses
- [ ] Theological/Belief: 5 courses
- [ ] Spiritual Development: 4 courses
- [ ] Worship Enhancement: 4 courses
- [ ] Historical/Narrative: 3 courses
- [ ] Contemporary Life: 3 courses
- [ ] Islamic Sciences: 3 courses
- [ ] NOTE: Marketing copy may regroup categories for readability, but course-to-category assignments must be accurate

## 2. Cross-Version Consistency

- [ ] All 3 versions cite the same subscriber count
- [ ] All 3 versions cite the same pricing ($15/mo, $120/yr)
- [ ] All 3 versions cite the same total courses (32), lectures (400), and hours (~80)
- [ ] Hafsah testimonial details are consistent across all uses (same daughter, same story beats)
- [ ] Scholar credentials are consistent (e.g., Qadhi's Yale PhD is mentioned the same way)
- [ ] No version contradicts another on any factual claim

---

## 3. Future-State Transparency

These features are described as if they exist but are part of the Two-Mode Model roadmap (not yet built):
- [ ] Daily verse + tafsir (push notification)
- [ ] Morning adhkar (5-min guided audio)
- [ ] Streak counter
- [ ] Home screen widget
- [ ] AI-powered assistant
- [ ] Progress dashboard
- [ ] Offline downloads

**Decision needed:** Does the copy need disclaimers like "coming soon" or are we writing Working Backwards press-release style as approved in the plan? (Plan says: Working Backwards -- selling the future state.)

---

## 4. Tone & Angle Consistency

- [ ] Version A stays in identity/crisis angle throughout (no sudden shift to access/authority)
- [ ] Version B stays in access/authority angle throughout (no extended emotional pain sections)
- [ ] Version C stays in family/community angle throughout (third-person "they" framing, not "you")
- [ ] Each version's CTA language matches its angle (A: "Start Learning", B: "See All Courses", C: "Give the Gift")

---

## 5. Hafsah Testimonial Differentiation

- [ ] Version A: Medium length, mid-page, supporting proof
- [ ] Version B: Short, single paragraph, data point
- [ ] Version C: Full-length lead story, emotional engine
- [ ] No version uses Hafsah's story at the same length or in the same position as another

---

## 6. Ad-to-Landing-Page Alignment

- [ ] Each ad's hook connects to its landing page's hero section
- [ ] Each ad's CTA text matches a CTA on the landing page
- [ ] No ad promises a feature or claim not present on the landing page
- [ ] Image direction in ads is compatible with landing page visual direction
