# CROSS-VERSION QA REPORT

## 1. Distinctness Check

| Dimension | Version A | Version B | Version C |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Emotional entry** | First-person pain (I'm drifting) | First-person frustration (I want access) | Third-person concern (they're drifting) |
| **Who is the reader?** | The person with the gap | The person who wants structure | The person watching someone else |
| **Hero headline** | Algorithm critique | Scholar name-drop | Emotional address to guardian |
| **Problem agitation** | Long, emotional, personal | Short, practical, late in page | Third-person, parental concern |
| **Lead section** | Hero + Problem | Hero + Scholar Showcase | Hero + Hafsah Testimonial |
| **Primary CTA language** | "Start Learning Today" | "See All 32 Courses" | "Give the Gift of Knowledge" |
| **Tone** | Warm, intimate, vulnerable | Confident, data-forward, premium | Empathetic, parental, urgent |
| **Visual direction** | Contemplative individual | Scholar grid, bold authority | Family/intergenerational warmth |

**Assessment:** The three versions are genuinely distinct. A reader would not confuse them. Each targets a different emotional state, uses a different structural emphasis, and speaks to a different persona.

## 2. Hafsah Testimonial Usage

| Version | Placement | Length | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | Section 9 (Social Proof) | Medium (~100 words) | Supporting proof -- shows transformation |
| **B** | Section 8 (Social Proof) | Short (~40 words) | Brief credibility reinforcement |
| **C** | Section 2 (Lead) | Full story (~400 words) | Emotional engine of the entire page |

**Assessment:** Hafsah is used differently in each version. Version C makes her the hero. Version A uses her as a mid-page proof point. Version B uses her as a brief data point. No redundancy.

## 3. Fact Consistency Check

| Fact | A | B | C | Consistent? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 32 courses | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 10 scholars/instructors | Yes | Yes (all 10 listed) | Yes | Yes |
| 5 headliner names (Qadhi, Suleiman, Mogahed, Basyouni, Abu Eesa) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| 5 additional instructors (Zubair, Quick, Tasleem, Hedroug, Ouarzazi) | Not listed | Yes (all listed) | Mentioned as "+5 more" | Yes |
| 400 lectures | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| $15/month | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| $120/year | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| $0.50/day | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |

| Streak counter | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Home screen widget | Yes | Yes | Not prominently featured | Acceptable |
| Offline downloads | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Progress dashboard | Yes | Yes | Not prominently featured | Acceptable |

**Assessment:** All critical facts are consistent across versions. Minor omissions in Version C are intentional -- the gift angle doesn't need every technical feature; it needs emotional resonance.

## 4. Ad-to-Landing-Page Alignment

| Ad | Landing Page Match | Hook-to-Hero Consistency |
|---|---|---|
| A1 (Question) | A: Hero addresses the knowledge gap | Yes -- ad names the gap, hero names the gap |
| A2 (5-Minute Morning) | A: Bridge section + Daily Habit Features | Yes -- ad promises 5 min, page delivers it |
| A3 (The Drift) | A: Problem Agitation (long, emotional) | Yes -- ad names the drift, page explores it deeply |
| B1 (The Roster) | B: Hero IS the scholar names | Yes -- ad leads with names, hero leads with names |
| B2 (Seminar Math) | B: Price Anchoring section | Yes -- ad compares cost, page builds full comparison |
| B3 (YouTube vs Curriculum) | B: Product Intro comparison table | Yes -- ad names the chaos, page structures the alternative |
| C1 (Hafsah's Story) | C: Section 2 Hafsah Testimonial | Yes -- ad tells abbreviated story, page tells full story |
| C2 (Someone You Love) | C: Hero + Problem Agitation | Yes -- ad names the concern, hero names the concern |
| C3 (The Door) | C: Final CTA ("open the door") | Yes -- ad uses the metaphor, page builds to it |

**Assessment:** Each ad logically leads to its corresponding landing page. No ad promises something the page doesn't deliver.

## 5. Missing or Weak Areas

| Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| No explicit mention of mobile app (Flutter rebuild) | Low | Add "Available on iOS, Android, and web" to trust bars -- already present in A |
| Course lesson counts | Fixed | All featured courses now use actual names and lecture counts from the Comprehensive Course Catalog |
| Hafsah testimonial details (month 14, 21-day streak) need verification | Medium | Confirm with Hafsah or adjust to approximate language |
| No mention of cancel/refund policy beyond "cancel anytime" | Low | Sufficient for landing page; checkout page should detail |
| $120/year described as "save $60" but also "$10/month" | Low | Both are accurate ($15 x 12 = $180 vs $120 = $60 savings) |
| AI assistant capabilities not yet built | Medium | Plan calls this future-state; ensure launch timing aligns |

---

## 6. Final Verdict

All 3 versions are:
- **Genuinely distinct** in angle, tone, structure, and emotional entry point
- **Factually consistent** on all key metrics and claims
- **Properly differentiated** in Hafsah testimonial usage
- **Ad-aligned** with logical hook-to-hero continuity

Ready for designer briefing and Phase 2 build.
