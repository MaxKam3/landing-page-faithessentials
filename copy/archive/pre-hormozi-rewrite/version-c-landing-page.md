## SECTION 1: HERO

**Headline:**
Your Words Aren't Enough. But the Right Scholars Might Be.

**Subheadline:**
When someone you love is drifting from their deen, you need more than advice. You need a way to connect them with real scholars, real structure, and a daily practice that meets them where they are. Faith Essentials is that way.

**Primary CTA Button:**
Give the Gift of Knowledge -- $10/Month

**Hero Visual Direction:**
[IMAGE: A warm, intergenerational moment -- a parent and young adult, or an older sibling with a younger one. Not posed. Candid. The feeling of care and concern, not a sales pitch. Soft, warm lighting. A phone visible but not central.]

## SECTION 2: HAFSAH TESTIMONIAL (LEAD -- Long Form)

**Section Header:**
"Faith Essentials did what my words couldn't."

**Hafsah's Full Story:**

My daughter came home from her first year of college different.

Not in the ways I expected -- the independence, the confidence, the opinions. Those were fine. It was the silence about Islam that worried me.

She'd stopped asking questions. When I'd mention a hadith or share something from a lecture, she'd nod politely. She'd pray sometimes, but the consistency was gone. The curiosity was gone. The fire was gone.

I tried everything a mother tries. I forwarded YouTube lectures. I bought her books. I brought up topics at dinner. I even signed her up for a weekend seminar once -- she went, but it didn't stick.

The truth I had to face: my words weren't enough. I'm not a scholar. And at 20 years old, she didn't want a lecture from her mother. She wanted to find her own way back -- on her own terms, in her own time.

A friend told me about Faith Essentials. I was skeptical. Another app? She already had Quran apps she never opened. But this was different -- it had scholars she'd actually heard of. Omar Suleiman. Yasmin Mogahed. Yasir Qadhi. And it had something I hadn't seen before: a daily practice built in. Not just courses. A morning verse with tafsir. Guided adhkar. A streak counter.

I gifted her a subscription and said nothing. No lecture. No "you should do this." Just a text: "I thought you might like this. No pressure."

Two weeks later, she mentioned something Shaykh Omar Suleiman said in one of his courses. At dinner. Casually. Like it was normal.

A month in, she had a 21-day streak and got genuinely frustrated when she almost forgot one evening. She started listening to the morning adhkar while getting ready for class.

She still doesn't pray five times a day. She still has questions I can't answer. But she's asking them again. She's engaged again. She's on a path again.

I didn't bring her back. I gave her a door. She walked through it.

That's what Faith Essentials is. Not a lecture. A door.

## SECTION 3: PROBLEM AGITATION

**Section Header:**
You can see it happening. And you don't know what to do.

**Body Copy:**

Maybe it's your son who stopped praying after he moved out. Maybe it's your younger sister who rolls her eyes when you mention anything about Islam. Maybe it's your friend's teenager who told them they're "not sure they believe anymore."

You know the feeling. The quiet dread when you realize someone you love is drifting. The conversations that go nowhere. The videos you forward that never get watched. The books you buy that collect dust.

You're not a scholar. You can't answer every question. You can't compete with the voices they're hearing at school, online, in their social circles -- voices that sound smart and make Islam sound outdated.

And the hardest part: the more you push, the further they pull away.

You need something that isn't you. Something that doesn't feel like pressure. Something they can engage with on their own terms -- at their own pace, in their own space, on their own phone.

Something with real scholars. Real depth. And a daily habit gentle enough to build without force.

## SECTION 4: BRIDGE

**Section Header:**
What if you could give them a path back -- without saying a word?

**Body Copy:**

Imagine gifting someone access to 10 of the most respected scholars in the English-speaking Muslim world. Not as a lecture. Not as a demand. Just as a gift.

They open the app and find a morning verse with tafsir waiting for them. Five minutes. No pressure. A 5-minute guided adhkar they can listen to while making breakfast.

When they're curious, there are 32 structured courses covering everything from the basics to the deep questions they're afraid to ask anyone. An AI assistant that answers immediately -- no embarrassment, no judgment.

When they're struggling, they can join a weekly live Q&A and ask a scholar directly. Not you. A scholar.

And a streak counter that quietly tracks their consistency -- not to guilt them, but to show them they're capable of showing up for their deen.

You give them the door. They decide when to walk through it.

## SECTION 6: SCHOLAR SHOWCASE

**Section Header:**
Scholars they've heard of. Scholars they'll listen to.

This is the part that makes Faith Essentials different from the YouTube links you've been forwarding. These aren't anonymous lecturers. These are names your family already recognizes.

**Scholar Cards:**

PhD from Yale. One of the most trusted voices in Western Islamic scholarship. 5 courses on Faith Essentials including *Faith & Belief* and *Pillars of Faith*. His courses go deeper than any YouTube clip.

**Ustadha Yasmin Mogahed**

## SECTION 9: GIFT CTA / PRICING

The best gift you can give them isn't advice. It's access.

## SECTION 10: OBJECTION HANDLING

**What students are saying:**

> "Faith Essentials has helped clarify some issues for me that tend to gnaw at me. And it is those kinds of questions that -- if left unanswered -- can turn into waswas and end up affecting my ibadah."
>
> -- **Sakeena Sheikh, FE Student**

> "I have learned so much that some information on each course I never knew before. MashaAllah I'm so glad to have our great teachers as our learning source."
>
> -- **Jameel Zafar, FE Student**

> "I like that it is in simple language. It gives me an opportunity to ask follow up questions and also the price as it is something that I can afford alhamdouillah."
>
> -- **Zak Rashid, FE Student**

**Section Header:**
The questions you're already asking yourself.

**Q: Will they actually use it?**

The daily push notification with a verse + tafsir takes 2 minutes to read. The morning adhkar is 5 minutes of audio. The streak counter creates a small daily commitment that builds over time. Hafsah's daughter started using it within 3 days of receiving the gift. The barrier to entry is 2 minutes. Most people walk through that door.

**Q: I've already tried sharing Islamic content with them.**

You shared content. This is a system. A daily habit + structured courses + AI assistant + live Q&A + streak tracking. Sharing a YouTube link is like handing someone a fish. This is a fishing rod, a tackle box, and a daily reminder to go to the water.

**Q: They'll think I'm pressuring them.**

Gift it like Hafsah did: "I thought you might like this. No pressure." The app is self-paced. No deadlines. No guilt. No one calling to check up. They engage on their own terms. That's the entire design philosophy.

**Q: $15/month for something they might not use?**

Try the monthly plan first. If they don't use it after 30 days, cancel. No contract. But consider: $15 is less than the lunch you'd buy them. And if it works -- if it reconnects them to their deen even slightly -- what's that worth to you?

**Q: Can't they just use free apps and YouTube?**

They can. They already have those options. Are they using them? The free content has been available for years. What's been missing is structure, daily habits, and scholars they trust -- all in one place that meets them where they are.

## SECTION 11: FINAL CTA + FOOTER

**Section Header:**
You can't want it for them. But you can open the door.

**Body Copy:**

You've watched them drift. You've said what you can say. You've shared what you can share.

Now give them something bigger than your words. Ten scholars. 32 courses. A daily verse on their lock screen. A streak that grows. An AI that answers the questions they won't ask you. A live Q&A where they can hear from a real scholar every week.

Not a lecture. Not a demand. A gift.

The door is $0.50 a day. Whether they walk through it -- that's between them and Allah.

But at least the door will be there.

## COPY NOTES FOR VERSION C

**Ralph Loop Decisions Applied:**
1. **Completeness:** All sections present. Hafsah testimonial moved to Section 2 (lead position) -- her story IS the emotional engine of Version C. Gift CTA added as a distinct section.
2. **Emotional Sharpening:** The entire page speaks to a parent/guardian's helplessness. Third-person framing throughout ("they" not "you"). Hafsah's story is told in full -- college daughter, specific behavioral changes, the turning point. Kitchen-table language.
3. **Objection Destruction:** The central objection shifts to "Will they actually use it?" -- addressed multiple times with specific mechanics (2-min verse, 5-min adhkar, streaks, self-paced). The "I've tried sharing content" objection is the Version C equivalent of "free content exists."
4. **Specificity:** Hafsah's daughter: 21-day streak, month 14, mentioned at dinner. Every feature described by its time commitment (2 min, 5 min, 10-15 min). Price compared to a birthday dinner, not just a coffee.
5. **Polish & Compression:** Hafsah's testimonial is intentionally long -- it carries the page. Other sections are more concise than Version A to compensate. Total word count stays comparable.

**Hafsah Testimonial Usage:** Full-length lead testimonial. This is Hafsah's page. Her story opens the emotional journey, and echoes of it appear throughout (objection handling, pricing section). She's the proof that this approach works.

**Differentiator from Versions A & B:** Version A speaks TO the person who's drifting. Version B speaks to the person who wants more access. Version C speaks to the person watching someone else drift. The emotional perspective is completely different -- it's secondhand concern, not firsthand pain.

**Word Count Target:** ~2,600 words (full read: ~10-11 minutes)
