## SECTION 2: PROBLEM AGITATION

**Section Header:**
You know this feeling.

**Body Copy:**

You grew up Muslim. You learned the basics -- how to pray, what to say, when to fast. But somewhere between childhood and now, a gap opened up.

Maybe it was a question a coworker asked that you couldn't answer. Maybe it was a doubt that crept in during a late night and never fully left. Maybe it was sitting in a khutbah and realizing you understood the Arabic words but not the meaning behind them.

You've tried to fix it. You've watched YouTube lectures at 2x speed. You've saved Instagram posts with beautiful calligraphy and good intentions. You've downloaded Quran apps you opened twice.

None of it stuck.

Not because you don't care. You care deeply. That's what makes the gap so painful -- the distance between how much your faith means to you and how little you feel you actually know.

You want to be the Muslim who can answer their child's questions with confidence. The one friends come to when they're struggling. The one who doesn't just feel their faith but understands it.

But right now, you're stuck between "I should know more" and "I don't know where to start."

And the worst part? Every day that passes, the gap gets a little wider.

## SECTION 3: BRIDGE

**Section Header:**
What if closing that gap only took 5 minutes a day?

**Body Copy:**

Not 5 hours. Not a weekend seminar you'll forget by Monday. Not another playlist you'll abandon by the third video.

Five minutes. Every morning. A verse and its tafsir, delivered to your phone before you even open your email. A 5-minute guided adhkar to ground your day. A streak counter that quietly proves you're growing.

And when you're ready for more -- 32 structured courses from scholars you actually trust, waiting for you at your own pace.

No prerequisites. No judgment. No pressure to keep up with anyone else.

Just a daily connection to your deen that actually builds into something real.

A guided audio to start your day grounded. Press play while you make your coffee. Five minutes. That's all.

**Streak Counter**
See your consecutive days of learning grow. 7 days. 30 days. 100 days. Every streak is proof that you're not drifting anymore -- you're building.

**Home Screen Widget**
Your current verse and streak, visible without opening the app. A quiet reminder on your lock screen that you're on a path.

**Push Notifications**
Gentle daily nudges. Not spam. A morning tap that says: your deen is waiting for you.

## SECTION 9: SOCIAL PROOF

**Section Header:**
10,000+ Muslims have learned with Faith Essentials. Here's one story.

**Hafsah Testimonial (Medium Length -- used as PROOF, not lead):**

> "I signed my daughter up because I could see her drifting. She'd stopped asking questions about Islam. She'd stopped praying regularly. I didn't know what to do -- my talks weren't working, and I'm not a scholar.
>
> Within two weeks, she was telling ME things she'd learned from Shaykh Omar Suleiman's course. She started a streak and got genuinely upset when she almost broke it. Now she listens to the morning adhkar while getting ready for class.
>
> I didn't give her a lecture. I gave her Faith Essentials. And it did what my words couldn't."
>
> -- **Hafsah M., mother of a college student**

**More from the community:**

> "Faith Essentials has helped clarify some issues for me that tend to gnaw at me. And it is those kinds of questions that -- if left unanswered -- can turn into waswas and end up affecting my ibadah."
>
> -- **Sakeena Sheikh, FE Student**

> "I have learned so much that some information on each course I never knew before. MashaAllah I'm so glad to have our great teachers as our learning source."
>
> -- **Jameel Zafar, FE Student**

> "I like that it is in simple language. It gives me an opportunity to ask follow up questions and also the price as it is something that I can afford alhamdouillah."
>
> -- **Zak Rashid, FE Student**

**Supporting Proof Points:**
- 10,000+ students have learned with Faith Essentials
- Built on AlMaghrib Institute's 20-year track record of Islamic education
- Available on iOS, Android, and web

## SECTION 10: OBJECTION HANDLING

**Section Header:**
Your questions, answered honestly.

**Q: There's so much free Islamic content on YouTube. Why would I pay?**

YouTube gave you 10,000 unstructured videos and no path forward. Faith Essentials gives you 32 structured courses from 10 scholars, daily verse + tafsir, an AI assistant for instant answers, and weekly live Q&A. YouTube is a library with no librarian. This is a curriculum with a daily practice.

**Q: I don't have time to study.**

You have 5 minutes. That's all the daily habit takes -- a verse, a tafsir, a morning adhkar. The courses are 10-15 minute lessons you can do on your commute. Download them offline. Listen while you cook. This was built for busy Muslims, not full-time students.

**Q: I always start things like this and quit.**

That's exactly what the streak counter, push notifications, and daily content are designed to prevent. When your learning shows up on your lock screen every morning, forgetting isn't an option. You don't have to remember to learn. The app remembers for you.

**Q: $15 a month feels like a lot.**

It's $0.50 a day. A single AlMaghrib seminar costs $200+. A private session with any of these scholars? Not possible. A coffee costs more than a day of Faith Essentials. And if you go annual, it's $120/year -- $10/month. For 10 scholars, 32 courses, 400 lectures, daily content, live Q&A, and an AI assistant.

## SECTION 11: PRICE ANCHORING & OFFER

**Section Header:**
What would you pay to close the gap?

**Body Copy:**

Let's be honest about the alternatives:

| Option | Cost |
|--------|------|
| One AlMaghrib seminar | $200+ |
| Private Islamic tutoring | $50-100/hour |
| Weekend conference | $150-300 |
| Islamic university (part-time) | $3,000+/year |
| **Faith Essentials (monthly)** | **$15/month** |
| **Faith Essentials (annual)** | **$120/year ($10/month)** |

That's $0.50 a day for 10 scholars, 32 courses, 400 lectures, daily verse + tafsir, morning adhkar, streak tracking, an AI assistant, weekly live Q&A, offline downloads, and a progress dashboard.

Less than a coffee. More than a library.

Cancel anytime. No contracts. No commitment beyond this month.

**[Go Annual -- $120/year (Save $60)]**
Best value. That's $10/month. Less than a single textbook.

## SECTION 12: FINAL CTA + FOOTER

**Section Header:**

Faith Essentials won't make you a scholar overnight. But it will give you 5 minutes every morning that add up. A verse that stays with you. A streak that proves you're growing. Courses that build real understanding. Scholars who answer your actual questions.

## COPY NOTES FOR VERSION A

**Ralph Loop Decisions Applied:**
1. **Completeness:** All 12 sections present. Angle (identity/crisis) is consistent throughout.
2. **Emotional Sharpening:** Problem Agitation section is intentionally long -- this is where Salma sees herself. "Kitchen table" language throughout. Second person, present tense.
3. **Objection Destruction:** Every major objection addressed. The pricing section makes NOT subscribing feel irrational by anchoring against real alternatives.
4. **Specificity:** Zero "many/some/various." Every claim has a number (32 courses, 10 scholars, 400 lectures, ~80 hours, $0.50/day, 10,000+ students, 10-15 min lessons, 5-min adhkar).
5. **Polish & Compression:** Every sentence earns its place. Works at 3 speeds: scan (headlines + stat stack), skim (headers + bold text), read (full copy).

**Hafsah Testimonial Usage:** Medium-length. Used as supporting proof in Section 9 -- not the hero. Shows transformation (daughter went from drifting to engaged) without making it the central narrative. Version C will make Hafsah the lead.

**Word Count Target:** ~2,200 words (full read: ~8-9 minutes)
