## SECTION 2: SCHOLAR SHOWCASE

**Section Header:**
10 scholars. All in one place. For the first time.

**Body Copy:**

You already know the headliners. You've watched their lectures, shared their clips, attended their events. But until now, there was no single place to study with all of them -- structured, on-demand, with live access.

**Scholar Cards -- Headliners:**

**Dr. Yasir Qadhi** -- 5 courses
PhD from Yale. On Faith Essentials: *Faith & Belief*, *Pillars of Faith*, *Predestination*, *What Is Faith*, and *Fiqh of Marriage & Divorce*.

**Shaykh Omar Suleiman** -- 4 courses

## SECTION 3: PRODUCT INTRODUCTION + COMPARISON

**Section Header:**
This isn't another Islamic content app. It's a curriculum.

**Body Copy:**

Built by AlMaghrib Institute -- 20 years of Islamic education trusted by hundreds of thousands of Muslims worldwide.

**What makes it different:**

| YouTube / Instagram | Faith Essentials |
|---|---|
| Random algorithm-fed clips | 32 structured courses with learning paths |
| Anonymous comment sections | Weekly live Q&A with actual scholars |
| No progress tracking | Visual dashboard showing your completion |
| Search and hope for answers | AI assistant for instant, sourced answers |
| Free but scattered | $0.50/day and structured |
| No daily practice | Daily verse + tafsir + morning adhkar + streaks |

---

## SECTION 4: PROBLEM AGITATION

**Section Header:**
You already know the problem.

**Body Copy:**

You follow the scholars on social media. You watch their clips. You attend their events when they come to your city.

But clips aren't courses. A 3-minute reel isn't a 24-lesson deep dive. A live event once a year isn't weekly access.

You've been assembling your Islamic education from scattered pieces -- a YouTube lecture here, a podcast there, a conference once a year. No structure. No progression. No way to know if you're building knowledge or just consuming content.

You don't need more content. You need a curriculum.

---

## SECTION 5: DAY 1 WALKTHROUGH

**Section Header:**
What your first day actually looks like.

**Body Copy:**

**Morning** -- A push notification arrives: today's verse with its tafsir. You read it in 2 minutes. Then you play the 5-minute guided adhkar while getting ready.

**Commute** -- You download Shaykh Yasir Qadhi's *Faith & Belief* course. The first lesson is 14 minutes. You finish it before you park.

**Lunch** -- A question from this morning's tafsir is nagging you. You ask the AI assistant. Instant answer, sourced from Islamic scholarship.

**Evening** -- You open the progress dashboard. One lesson complete. One streak day logged. You browse the course catalog and add *Fiqh of Prayer* to your queue.

Total time invested: 23 minutes. Structured. Tracked. No algorithm involved.

---

## SECTION 6: COURSE LIBRARY

**Section Header:**
32 courses. 7 categories. A curriculum, not a playlist.

**Body Copy:**

Each course is built to take you from introduction to understanding, in a sequence designed by the scholars themselves.

**Fiqh (11 courses)** -- The largest category. Prayer, purification, fasting, hajj, food, clothing, marriage, death, entertainment, Ramadan, zakah. Taught by Shaykh Abu Eesa, Shaykh Waleed Basyouni, Shaykh Saad Tasleem, Shaykh Omar Hedroug, and Shaykh Yasir Qadhi.

**Theology (5 courses)** -- *Faith & Belief*, *Pillars of Faith*, *Predestination*, *What Is Faith*, *Names of Allah*. Taught by Shaykh Yasir Qadhi and Shaykh Waleed Basyouni.

**History (3 courses)** -- *Through the Fire* (17 lectures), *Unbroken*, *New Dawn* (16 lectures). Islamic history as narrative.

**Contemporary Life (3 courses)** -- Money, family, and living as a Muslim minority. Practical rulings for the life you're actually living.

**Islamic Sciences (3 courses)** -- *Principles of Islamic Law*, *Muslim Ethics*, *Sunnah & Bid'ah*. The methodological foundations.

## SECTION 7: FEATURES

**Section Header:**
Courses build your knowledge. Daily habits build your connection.

**Body Copy:**

**The daily practice:**
Morning verse + tafsir (2 minutes to read). Guided adhkar (5 minutes of audio). Streak counter tracking consecutive days. Home screen widget showing your verse and streak before you open your email.

**The study tools:**
Progress dashboard across every course. Offline downloads for your commute. Structured learning paths for beginner, intermediate, or advanced. 10-15 minute lessons -- not hour-long lectures.

**The live access:**

**The instant answer:**

## SECTION 8: DREAM OUTCOME -- "MONTH 3"

**Section Header:**
Three months from now.

**Body Copy:**

Your streak counter says 87. You've completed 4 courses -- theology, fiqh of prayer, and two on spiritual development. You're halfway through a fifth.

At your halaqa, someone raises a question about qadr. You don't fumble. You explain the scholarly framework from Shaykh Yasir Qadhi's *Predestination* course -- specific, nuanced, sourced. People notice.

At this week's live Q&A, you asked Shaykh Waleed Basyouni about a fiqh ruling you'd been carrying for months. He answered directly. The question that had been sitting in the back of your mind for years was resolved in 90 seconds.

Your morning adhkar is automatic now. The verse notification is the first thing you read each day. Your progress dashboard shows 37% of the full curriculum completed -- a number that's growing weekly.

You're not consuming Islamic content anymore. You're building systematic knowledge. And you can feel the difference in every conversation, every prayer, every decision.

## SECTION 9: SOCIAL PROOF

**Section Header:**
10,000+ students chose structure over scrolling.

**Hafsah Testimonial (Short -- supporting proof):**

> "My daughter went from skipping prayers to quoting Shaykh Omar Suleiman at the dinner table. The daily streak turned learning into a habit. Faith Essentials did what my lectures at home couldn't."
>
> -- **Hafsah M., subscriber**

**More from the community:**

> "Faith Essentials has helped clarify some issues for me that tend to gnaw at me. And it is those kinds of questions that -- if left unanswered -- can turn into waswas and end up affecting my ibadah."
>
> -- **Sakeena Sheikh, FE Student**

> "I like that it is in simple language. It gives me an opportunity to ask follow up questions and also the price as it is something that I can afford alhamdouillah."
>
> -- **Zak Rashid, FE Student**

**Supporting Stats:**
- Built on AlMaghrib Institute's 20-year track record
- Average course rating: 4.7/5

## SECTION 10: OBJECTION HANDLING

**Section Header:**
The objections you're already thinking of.

**Q: I already follow these scholars on YouTube and social media.**

Following isn't studying. Shaykh Waleed Basyouni's 26-lecture *Journey to the Hereafter* covers more depth than years of clips. Plus: structured paths, progress tracking, and weekly live Q&A. None of that exists on YouTube.

**Q: SeekersGuidance and Yaqeen are free. Why pay $15/month?**

Neither has this scholar roster, structured progress tracking, daily verse + tafsir, streak mechanics, an AI assistant, and weekly live Q&A -- all in one place. You're paying for curation and structure, not content that exists elsewhere.

**Q: I attended AlMaghrib seminars. How is this different?**

One seminar costs $200+ and covers one topic. Faith Essentials gives you 32 courses -- the equivalent of 16+ seminars -- plus daily content, live Q&A, and an AI assistant. For $15/month.

**Q: Will I actually finish courses?**

Every course is 10-15 minute lessons. The streak counter, progress dashboard, and push notifications are designed to make completion the default, not the exception.

## COPY NOTES FOR VERSION B (POST-HORMOZI REWRITE)

**Changes from pre-rewrite version:**

1. **Subheadline fixed** -- Removed unsubstantiated "most comprehensive Islamic learning platform in the English-speaking world" superlative. Replaced with factual "Built by AlMaghrib Institute."
2. **Scholar showcase tightened** -- Headliner bios cut ~25% each (removed generic descriptors like "Former Dean of Academic Affairs," kept credentials + course specifics). Bottom 5 instructors collapsed from 5 separate bio blocks into a single compact line with key highlights.
3. **Problem agitation moved earlier** -- From Section 7 to Section 4, right after the comparison table creates context. Still brief (appropriate for Kareem's persona) but no longer buried.
4. **Day 1 Walkthrough added** -- New Section 5 showing Kareem's first day: morning verse + adhkar, commute course, lunch AI question, evening dashboard. Total: 23 minutes.
5. **Dream Outcome added (Month 3)** -- New Section 8 painting Kareem at a halaqa explaining qadr from Shaykh Yasir Qadhi's course, getting a fiqh question answered in live Q&A, 87-day streak, 37% curriculum completion. Specific to THIS persona (committed learner wanting depth, not a beginner).
6. **Two feature sections merged** -- Organized by mode (daily practice / study tools / live access / instant answer) instead of repetitive feature cards.
7. **Objection answers cut ~40%** -- Each answer is now 2-3 sentences. Removed redundant stat repetition within answers.
8. **Hormozi Value Stack added** -- Pricing section now presents each component with standalone dollar value. Total: $4,000+/year vs $120/year.
9. **Risk reversal added** -- "Try it for 30 days. If it doesn't change how you learn your deen, cancel with one tap."
10. **Final CTA drastically tightened** -- Removed the full scholar name list and complete stat dump that repeated everything. Now 2 sentences + CTA.
11. **Stat repetition reduced** -- The full stat dump ("32 courses, 400 lectures, 10 scholars") appears once in the hero subheadline and once in the course library header. Other sections reference specific contextual stats without repeating the full list.
12. **Redundant sentence removed** -- "It takes the depth of a seminary and the convenience of your phone, and puts both in your pocket" (redundant "pocket" = "phone").

**Word Count Target:** ~2,000 words (down from ~2,400 -- approximately 17% reduction)

**Hormozi Scorecard (post-rewrite):**
- Dream Outcome: Strong (Month 3 section shows Kareem at halaqa, live Q&A, systematic knowledge)
- Perceived Likelihood: Strong (Day 1 walkthrough, comparison table, 10,000+ students)
- Time Delay: Strong (Day 1 shows results from morning one; 23 minutes total)
- Effort & Sacrifice: Strong ($0.50/day, 10-15 min lessons, risk reversal)
